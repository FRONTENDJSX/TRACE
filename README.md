# TRACE  
Technical Recognition and Contextual Evaluation  
Human-like perception system for AI — open-source, modular, privacy-aware.

---

## 🤖 Overview

TRACE is an **AI-powered human recognition engine** that identifies people using **human-like perception**, not rigid biometric rules.

Instead of depending on a single face or fixed vector, TRACE builds and compares a **rich multilayer identity profile**:

- 🧠 **Anatomical geometry** (face + body ratios, proportions, structure)
- 🔷 **Shape & contour signatures** (jawline, silhouette, hairline curve)
- 🎛️ **Color context mapping** (hair, skin undertones — *informative, not absolute*)
- 🎯 **Accessory awareness** (glasses, bracelets — *never required to match*)
- 📉 **Expression averaging** (learned over time, not single-frame dependent)

Every person is stored under an **anonymous internal ID** — TRACE only learns a name if explicitly told.

## ⚡ Why TRACE?

| Traditional Face ID            | TRACE                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| One-shot accept/reject        | Soft-probability human-style recognition (confidence %)  |
| Breaks with glasses/hair      | Adapts, evolves familiarity over time                    |
| Needs manual enrollment        | Can self-learn passively if permitted                   |
| Binary decision               | Returns **top match with confidence score**              |

## 🎯 Default Recognition Logic

- **85%+ anatomical similarity** → assumed positive recognition  
- Accessories add **up to +2%** confidence boost  
- Expressions influence match score **<1%**  
- **Highest match is always selected**, even among equally rated candidates  

> TRACE is designed to recognize like a human — not lock like a security gate.

## ✅ Features

- Compatible with **any camera input** (RGB first — LiDAR planned)
- Works for **face + torso** or full-body recognition
- **Anonymous identity system** (ID-first, name-optional)
- Adaptive memory — **can evolve identity knowledge over time**
- Optional manual **“rescan”** or structured recall command
